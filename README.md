# xrv124

![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-green.svg)

A set of scripts for the analysis and visualization of data acquired by the Logos XRV-124 scintillating cone. Analysis currently includes, for a selection of gantry angles and beam energies:

  * Spot shifts (in x and y of the BEV coordinates)
  * Spot sizes (in both BEV and "spot" coordinate systems; see documentation)  

See the xrv124/example_results directory for some examples of the data generated by the script. 
A summary pdf report detailing individual QA tolerance pass/fail results is generated for the monthly QA script.


## Usage
To run the monthly QA analysis: ```python xrv124_run.py```.  

You will need the full data set acquired during monthly QA, with beams corresponding to the gantry angles and energies specified in xrv124_run.py. You can find a sample data set on the O drive in my work in progress folder, /Logos XRV124/Sample data/2020 0102/.  

For analysis of a single beam: ```python single_spot_script.py```.  

The script will prompt you for a beam file. You may select any file, but both the entry (.csv) and exit (.txt) spot files must be present in the directory
for the analysis to run. Script will output the shifts in BEV coordinates as well as spot sizes.


## Limitations / known bugs
In this first version there are several limitations:

  * The monthly QA analysis will only run on the full data set. The logos software does not have a way of recognising beam energy, hence if any beam was not captured during the acquisition it would not be possible to match the output files generated with a specific gantry angle and energy.
  * Spot images may saturate if the wrong acquisition parameters are used. This will mean any Gaussian fit when extracting sigmas will not be reliable.
  * Apparently very occasionally the entry and exit spot images can be of different sizes. I have not dealt with this yet.
